django-bitcoin example project
================================

This project shows how to use `django-bitcoin to receive and send money in your Python + Django application <https://github.com/kangasbros/django-bitcoin>`_.

It shows how to create a bitcoin wallet, accept incoming bitcoins and then spend them.
This all is done interactively from the command line and Python prompt.

This tutorial was written on OSX. It should work on Linux unmodified.
Windows: don't know and don't care.

Why accept bitcoin in your online service
-----------------------------------------------

* Bitcoin is money with API: very easy to handle programmatically. You can do it even from UNIX command line.

* No upfront contracts or paperwork needed.

* `Bitcoin market liquity has risen to a level, so that it is easy for everyone to obtain bitcoins from LocalBitcoins.com <https://localbitcoins.com?ch=1af>`_. You can also convert bitcoins easily back to fiat currency, when you need to pay taxes.

* It is free from chargeback fraud. The system is based on mathematics instead of trust.

* Very low fees (0.01% compared to 2-5% by credit card, PayPal)

-----------------------------------------------
Prerequisitements

Tutorial walkthrough
-----------------------------------------------

`django-bitcoin <https://github.com/kangasbros/django-bitcoin>`_ creates a so called
bitcoin web wallet in your Django project.

* You need to have a `bitcoind <http://bitcoin.org/en/download>`_ installed on your desktop / server.

* ``django-bitcoin`` reads transactions from ``bitcoind`` and duplicates them as Django models for easy handling

* ``django-bitcoin`` can send bitcoins from the system

* Bitcoin addresses are created and used on demand. The sending and receiving addresses do not have
  relationship between them. When you receive bitcoins to your system they do not leave out from
  the same address. This is who most bitcoin web wallets behave.

Configuring bitcoind
========================

Install `bitcoind <https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoind>`_.

Note that the initial installation takes hefty 10-20 GB disk space for the block chain data.
Blockchain contains all transaction history of bitcoin ever. Downloading this
data while take a while.

* *django-bitcoin* communites with bitcoind over JSON-RPC protocol. You set the bitcoind address in ``settings.py``

* ``bitcoind`` transaction handling is done as polling, using Django management commands

Configure your bitcoind to accept connection with username and password.

Create file ``example/localsettings.py` and let's put there in confidential settings
(not stored on Github)::

    BITCOIND_CONNECTION_STRING = "http://miguel:passwor@example.com:8332"

    # How many bitcoin network confirmations are required until django-bitcoin considers the transaction
    # as received
    BITCOIN_MINIMUM_CONFIRMATIONS = 1

    # Use Django signals to tell the system when new money has arrived to your wallets
    BITCOIN_TRANSACTION_SIGNALING = True

Initializing database
==========================

``django-bitcoin`` uses South for its schema management.
Create a database (sqlite ``test.db`` file by default)::

    python manage.py syncdb
    python manage.pt migrate django_bitcoin

Do a test run
=================

Let's open the development web server and see that the Django admin is up with ``django-bitcoin``::

    python manage.py runserver_plus

Visit ``http://localhost:8000/admin`` to see the Django admin interface having addresses,
wallets and such:

Creating a wallet
====================

A wallet, ``django_bitcoin.models.Walletx``,
is a combination of receiving and sending bitcoin addresses and
stores the bitcoin value associated with these addresses.
A wallet can have infinite number of sending and receiving bitcoin addresses.

Let's start interactive IPython prompt::

    python manage.py shell_plus

Then we create a wallet with an label. Usually if the application has only one wallet (not per user wallets)
you call this wallet instance to *master wallet*::

    master_wallet, created = Wallet.objects.get_or_create(label="master_wallet")

Then we need to have an receiving bitcoin address where this wallet can receive bitcoins::

    recv_address = master_wallet.receiving_address(fresh_addr=False)
    print recv_address

Write down the bitcoin address you got.

Purchase some test bitcoins
=======================================

Go to `LocalBitcoins.com and buy some bitcoins <https://localbitcoins.com/?ch=1af>`_.
LocalBitcoins.com is a person-to-person bitcoin exchange where you are not buying
bitcoins from the organization, but from another user.
This is definitely the easiest and fastest way to obtain your first bitcoins.
Think LocalBitcoins as eBay of bitcoins.

LocalBitcoins.com provides diffferent online payment methods.
The recommended methods are:

* Cash deposit (inverse ATM popular in US) - no id needed

* National bank transfer - the bitcoin seller may require you to show an id

If you are living a big city you can also try cash trade.

`You can buy small amounts of bitcoins from me <https://localbitcoins.com/p/opensourcehacker?ch=1af>`_.
If you want to purchase bitcoins with PayPal agree it with beforehand,
as PayPal bitcoin sell advertisements are hidden by default to avoid frauduleint buy requests.

Accepting incoming transaction
====================================

We have the receiving bitcoin address of our master wallet from before.
Now we are going to send the bitcoins there from LocalBitcoins:

.. image:: https://raw.github.com/miohtama/django-bitcoin-example/master/images/send.png
    :width: 800

When you hit the *Send* on LocalBitcoins.com, the site submits the transaction to
the bitcoin network. Bitcoin network consists of nodes which will confirm your transaction.
After the certain transaction confirmation threshold is exceeded you can assume the transaction
was safe and not double spent attempt. Usually this confirmation threshold is six
confirmations, but you can set it lower if you want to have faster customer
experience. It takes 5-30 minutes to process a transaction
with six confirmations.

Now, in our own example application polls ``bitcoind`` which listens
to bitcoin network. `bitcoind exposes a bunch of commands
over JSON-RPC protocol <https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/API_reference_%28JSON-RPC%29>`_.
You can call these commands even from the UNIX command line.

We have a Django management command for polling bitcoind.
On each poll, we check the incoming transaction for receiving
bitcoin addresses we have in our database. When the bitcoin
network keeps confirming our transaction, the confirmation count
of the transaction increases. When the threshold is exceeded,
``django-bitcoin`` writes down the transaction to the database
as ``DepositTransaction`` and the amount of bitcoins in the
wallet is increased.

For this example we run the polling command by hand.
Usually this is a task delegated to Celery task scheduler::

    python manage.py CheckTransactions

.. image:: https://raw.github.com/miohtama/django-bitcoin-example/master/images/poll.png
    :width: 800

Checking the balance
===========================

``CheckTransactions`` fires the Django signal handlers
notifying the Django project for incoming transactions.
For the simplicity, we do not use Django signalling in this example.
Instead, we manually run ``CheckTransactions``
and after 20 minutes and see
that the bitcoins have been received in our wallet::

    python manage.py shell_plus
    master_wallet = Wallet.objects.get(label="master_wallet")
    print master_wallet.total_balance()

.. image:: https://raw.github.com/miohtama/django-bitcoin-example/master/images/balance.png
    :width: 800

Spending the bitcoins
========================

Now, we got the coins! Time to make some purchases.
We go to an online shop selling high quality Brazilian music.

Then we'll send the bitcoins from our wallet to buy this wondeful
piece of art.

.. image:: https://raw.github.com/miohtama/django-bitcoin-example/master/images/spend.png
    :width: 800

All bitcoin amounts are stored in Python ``decimal.Decimal`` instead of
floats to avoid floating point rounding errors.

We fire up the Python shell again and send the bitcoins to the target address::

    python manage.py shell_plus
    from decimal import Decimal
    master_wallet = Wallet.objects.get(label="master_wallet")
    master_wallet.send_to_address("1Bk1Gwo6KVu2a85YkqHAPtdxmS8xHejDUB", Decimal("0.0505"), "Bought Michel Telo MP3")

Note that for every outgoing transaction there is a bitcoin network fee
to compensate the bitcoin miners for confirming your transaction.
The network fee is configured to be 0.0005 BTC in ``django_bitcoind`` by default.
So the total amount to be send is the checkout price + network fee.
Higher the paid network fee, faster the transaction is processed by bitcoin network.

.. image:: https://raw.github.com/miohtama/django-bitcoin-example/master/images/outgoing.png
    :width: 800

Checking outgoing and past transactions
========================================

We can check the outgoing transactions from our wallet::

     for t in WalletTransaction.objects.filter(from_wallet=master_wallet):
        print t, t.to_bitcoinaddress

.. image:: https://raw.github.com/miohtama/django-bitcoin-example/master/images/history.png
    :width: 800

If you enter the receiving address to `blockchain.info <blockchain.info>`_
you can see its transaction statuses in the bitcoin network.

And that's it. Nossa!
